** What is CLIfe?
CLIfe is my try on a text adventure / RPG-game, written in C :)

A real story is not implemented yet, because the game is still in planning
stage.

As of currently the code seems to be limited to GCC, I tried it on Clang
(OpenBSD) and it did not work.
** Status Quo
15% of necessary functions are implemented.
I am satisfied with 20% of implemented functions.

The Item system is currently on hold, until I have a better plan on how to work it out.
To not make it harder for me to reach the goal of a complete english translation,
function names and comments will form now on be created in English.
** To-Dos
*** TODO English Translation
| When?      | Before the first Release |
| Completed? | To ~66%.                 |
