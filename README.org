** What is CLIfe?
CLIfe is a singleplayer RPG game written in C.
It takes inspiration from the classic MUDs from the past and present, and is
still in early stage.

** Requirements
To compile, you need:
- gcc or a comparable compiler
- gnu standard libraries (see [[https://github.com/cheeesy/clife/issues/7][Compilation Error on OpenBSD 6.6]])
- ncurses development libraries
** Supported Operating Systems
| OS                  | Working? |
|---------------------+----------|
| openSUSE x64 (gcc)  | Yes      |
| openBSD x64 (clang) | No [^1]   |
| Windows 10 x64      | No [^2]   |

[^1]: OpenBSD support seems to be a problem due to the style of programming and
will be addressed as soon as possible.
[^2]: Windows Support will be addressed once the game is in a more mature
state. For this matter another branch will be opened, as ncurses support is
not given on Windows.

** Status Quo
CLIfe is still in a very early 'infancy' stage. I would not consider it
playable yet, as it has no content that is fun for a player. This will
hopefully begin to change in the next few months.
