** What is CLIfe?
CLIfe is my try on a text adventure / RPG-game, written in C :)

A real story is not implemented yet, because the game is still in planning stage.
** Why are there files just called '0'?
Files called '0' are just place holders and ensure that GitHub creates those folders, or rather, doesn't delete them.

The folders will, when running the game, be written with data and are necessary.
** To-Dos
